# IoT_Message_Box_Workshop

Introduction to programming microcontrollers for IoT applications and interfacing them with AWS IoT Core

This workshop was prepared by [Andy](http://andy.rawmatter.io) from [Raw Matter](http://rawmatter.io) as part of an introductory workshop for creating _Things_ that connect to the AWS IoT Core. Raw Matter develop robotics, electronics or software for commercial applications we would welcome the chance to discuss your needs with you.

# Workshop Structure

The workshop is broken down into 7 phases.

1. Development toolchain
2. Connecting to a micro controller
3. Interacting with a micro controller and updating a display
4. Connecting the microcontroller to Wi-Fi
5. Communicating to AWS via the MQTT protocol
6. Handling messages from AWS
7. Connecting AWS IoT core to a lambda function and website

At completion of the workshop, you will be able to give people a unique URL that they can use to send messages and have them display on your very own device!

# Requirements

You will need

1. Laptop with a USB port
2. A TTGO T-Display
3. An AWS account with admin privileges
4. A sense of adventure

# Accessing the workshop

When you are ready to dive in, the workshop is broken down by phase in the `Workshop` directory!

The `README.md` files go through the steps and if you get stuck, spoilers (sample code) is provided. If you get REALLY stuck or are encountering errors, full Platform IO solutions are available at each step from [this repository](https://github.com/RawMatter/IoT_Message_Box_Workshop_Solutions)
