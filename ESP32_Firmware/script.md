Hi Everyone 
My Name is Andy and today we are delving into the world of IoT

I'm lucky to have had a pretty broad range of experience in my career so far.
Everything from 330,000V substations at mine sites through to high precision robotics and data acquisition system at the university of WA.
At the begining of 2019 I started doing my first serious work on AWS and realised that git was a pretty useful tool as well.

In March I formed Raw Matter, a contract engineering company that does Robotics and electronics development for small and medium business.

So I think I'm well placed to help those of you who have not dabled much with electronics to bridge the divide and make the physical relm a little less daunting

Why would we want to explore IoT and electronics at a DevOps conference?
I think its a good reminder that the principles of DeVOps can be applied to more than lambda functions and containers.
With some of the services and concepts we will explore today its the cheapest way to explore DevOps at the edge, and AWS Outpost is a bit outsiode my budget.

So with that out of the way

What are we making today...

This is a love box... its a small device that allows you to send messages and pictures to a small display, as a way of staying connected and being a bit cute at the same time
I think its a lovely idea and a great example of an innovative way to stay connected during a pandemic but I'm cheap. These boxes are almost $200!!!
Unfortunately for this company (and my wife) I have access to a number of AWS services and some much cheaper hardware out of China.

So I'll give you all a quick overview of the AWS services for context and then we will jump into the hardware.

There are two flagship AWS IoT services
Core & Greengrass

We are also going to be using AWS Lambda and API gateway

DevOps

Steps For hardware:
* Install VSCode
* Install PlatformIO extension
* Create a new project
